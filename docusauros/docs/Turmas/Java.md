# Java Roadmap

## üå± Beginner Level (Basics & Syntax)

**Focus:** Variables, conditionals, loops, basic input/output.

### 1. Simple Calculator

#### Exercise Title
Simple Calculator Application

#### Learning Objectives
- Use of variables to store data.
- Use of conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`) to control program flow.
- Use of loops (`while` or `do-while`) to allow repeated operations.
- Handling user input and output using `Scanner`.

#### Exercise Instructions (for students)
Write a Java program that functions as a simple calculator. The program should:

1. Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
2. Prompt the user to choose an operation:
    - `+` for addition
    - `-` for subtraction
    - `*` for multiplication
    - `/` for division
3. Perform the selected operation and display the result.
4. After displaying the result, ask the user if they want to perform another calculation.
5. If the user says "yes", repeat the process. If "no", exit the program.

**Constraints:**
- Handle division by zero gracefully.
- Use a loop to repeat the calculator until the user decides to quit.

#### üìò Example Output

```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): *
Result: 10 * 5 = 50

Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): yes

Enter first number: 8
Enter second number: 0
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): /
Error: Cannot divide by zero.

Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no

Thank you for using the calculator!
```

#### üë©‚Äçüè´ Teacher‚Äôs Answer Key (Sample Solution)

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SimpleCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String continueCalc;

        do {
            System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
            double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();

            System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
            double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();

            System.out.print("Enter operation (+, -, *, /): ");
            char operator = scanner.next().charAt(0);

            double result;
            boolean valid = true;

            switch (operator) {
                case '+':
                    result = num1 + num2;
                    System.out.println("Result: " + num1 + " + " + num2 + " = " + result);
                    break;
                case '-':
                    result = num1 - num2;
                    System.out.println("Result: " + num1 + " - " + num2 + " = " + result);
                    break;
                case '*':
                    result = num1 * num2;
                    System.out.println("Result: " + num1 + " * " + num2 + " = " + result);
                    break;
                case '/':
                    if (num2 == 0) {
                        System.out.println("Error: Cannot divide by zero.");
                        valid = false;
                    } else {
                        result = num1 / num2;
                        System.out.println("Result: " + num1 + " / " + num2 + " = " + result);
                    }
                    break;
                default:
                    System.out.println("Invalid operation.");
                    valid = false;
            }

            System.out.print("\nDo you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): ");
            continueCalc = scanner.next();

        } while (continueCalc.equalsIgnoreCase("yes"));

        System.out.println("Thank you for using the calculator!");
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
